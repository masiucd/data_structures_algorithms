# Just Algorithms and Data Structures

## About

This repository contains my implementations of various algorithms and data structures. I am using this repository to learn more about algorithms and data structures.
To view the implementations, and visualize the algorithms is what this application will provide.

The goal is tow show implementations in different languages but for now it is only JavaScript/Typescript and Rust.
