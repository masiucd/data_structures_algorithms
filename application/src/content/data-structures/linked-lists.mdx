## What is Linked List?

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Types of Linked List

1. **Singly Linked List** : In this type of linked list, each node in the list is connected to the next node in the list. The last node is connected to null.

2. **Doubly Linked List** : In this type of linked list, each node in the list is connected to the next node and the previous node.

3. **Circular Linked List** : In this type of linked list, the last node is connected to the first node.

## Advantages of Linked List

1. **Dynamic Size** : A linked list is a dynamic data structure so it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory.
   So there is no need to give the initial size of the linked list.

2. **Insertion and Deletion** : Insertion and deletion of nodes are really easier. Unlike an array here we donâ€™t have to shift elements after insertion or deletion of an element. In a linked list, we can insert elements anywhere in the list.

3. **No Memory Wastage** : In a linked list, the memory is allocated only when we need to insert a new element.

## Disadvantages of Linked List

1. **Memory Usage** : A linked list uses more memory compare to an array because of the storage used by their pointers.

2. **Traversal** : In a linked list, the traversal is more time-consuming because we can not access the elements randomly. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node.

3. **Reverse Traversal** : In a singly linked list, reverse traversal is not possible until we keep track of the previous node.

## Operations on Linked List

1. **Insertion** : Insertion is done at the beginning, end, or at a given position in the linked list.

2. **Deletion** : Deletion is done at the beginning, end, or at a given position in the linked list.

3. **Traversal** : Accessing each element of the linked list.

4. **Searching** : Searching for an element in the linked list.

5. **Sorting** : Sorting the linked list.

6. **Reversing** : Reversing the linked list.

## Implementation of Linked List

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

type Node struct {
  data int
  next *Node
}

type LinkedList struct {
  head *Node
}

func (l *LinkedList) insert(data int) {
  newNode := &Node{data: data}
  if l.head == nil {
    l.head = newNode
  } else {
    lastNode := l.head
    for lastNode.next != nil {
      lastNode = lastNode.next
    }
    lastNode.next = newNode
  }
}

func (l *LinkedList) display() {
  currentNode := l.head
  for currentNode != nil {
    fmt.Println(currentNode.data)
    currentNode = currentNode.next
  }
}

func main() {
  l := LinkedList{}
  l.insert(10)
  l.insert(20)
  l.insert(30)
  l.display()
}
```

## Conclusion

Linked List is a linear data structure. It is a collection of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In a linked list, each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked list is a dynamic data structure so it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory. Insertion and deletion of nodes are really easier in a linked list. But the traversal is more time-consuming because we can not access the elements randomly. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. In a singly linked list, reverse traversal is not possible until we keep track of the previous node.
