# Stack

The stack data structure is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure. It is
useful for implementing a number of algorithms, such as depth-first search.

## Description

Implement a stack data structure where the push and pop methods are both O(1) operations.

## Example

```shell
stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)
stack.pop() # 3
stack.pop() # 2
stack.pop() # 1
```
