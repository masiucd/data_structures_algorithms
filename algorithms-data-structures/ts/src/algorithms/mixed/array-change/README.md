# Array change

## Description

You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its element by one. Find the minimal number of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.

## Example

For `inputArray = [1, 1, 1]`, the output should be `arrayChange(inputArray) = 3`.

## Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n)` and the space complexity is `O(1)`. Where `n` is the length of the input array.
