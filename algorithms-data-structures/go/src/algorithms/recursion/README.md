# Recursion in GO

## What is Recursion?
 
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until a base condition is satisfied.


## Why Recursion?

Recursion is a very powerful tool for solving certain problems. It is very elegant and concise. It is also very easy to understand. However, recursion is not always the best tool for the job. It can be very inefficient and can lead to stack overflow errors.
