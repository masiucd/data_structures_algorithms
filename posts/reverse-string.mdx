## Problem

Write a function that reverses a string.
The input is a string of characters.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "hello"

Output: "olleh"
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: "world"
Output: "dlrow"
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: "a"
Output: "a"
```

## Solutions

### TypeScript/JavaScript

<Box>
  ```ts showLineNumbers title="for loop" 
  function reverseString(str: string): string {
    let reversed = "";
  
    for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      reversed += str[i];
    }
  
    return reversed;
  }
  ```
  
  ## Explanation
  
  Here we are using a `for` loop to iterate over the string from the end to the beginning.
  We are starting from the last character and adding it to the `reversed` string.
  Time complexity is `O(n)`.
  Space complexity is `O(n)`.
</Box>

<Box>
  ```ts title="while loop" showLineNumbers
  function reverseString(str: string): string {
    let reversed = "";
    let i = str.length - 1;
  
    while (i >= 0) {
      reversed += str[i];
      i--;
    }
  
    return reversed;
  }
  ```

<Box>
  ```ts title="array reverse" showLineNumbers
  function reverseString(str: string): string {
    return str.split("").reverse().join("");
  }
  ```
  
  ## Explanation
  
  Here we are splitting the string into an array of characters, reversing the array and joining it back into a string.
  Time complexity is `O(n)`.
  Space complexity is `O(n)`.

```ts title="recursion" showLineNumbers
function reverseString(str: string): string {
  if (str.length === 0) return "";

  return reverseString(str.slice(1)) + str[0];
}
```

## Explanation

Here we are using recursion to reverse the string.
We are slicing the string from the second character to the end and adding the first character to the end of the string.
We are doing this until the string is empty.
Time complexity is `O(n)`.
Space complexity is `O(n)`.

  ```rust title="for loop" 
  fn reverse_string(str: &str) -> String {
    let mut reversed = String::new();
  
    for c in str.chars().rev() {
      reversed.push(c);
    }
  
    reversed
  }
  ```

    let mut reversed = String::new();
    let mut i = str.len() - 1;
  
    while i >= 0 {
      reversed.push(str.chars().nth(i).unwrap());
      i -= 1;
    }
  
    reversed
  }
  ```
