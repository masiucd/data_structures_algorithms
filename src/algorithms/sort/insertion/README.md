# Insertion sort


## About
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
Insertion sort is a common algorithm used in computer science.
