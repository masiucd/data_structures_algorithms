# Find error nums

Given an array nums representing the data of the numbers from 1 to n, where n is the length of the array, some elements appear twice and others appear only once.

Return an array containing the numbers that appear twice and the numbers that are missing.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space.

## Example 1

```go
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]
```

## Example 2

```go
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,2]
```
