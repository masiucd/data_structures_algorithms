# Find difference

Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is the total number of elements in nums1 that are not in nums2.
answer[1] is the total number of elements in nums2 that are not in nums1.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
Explanation: The elements that are not in nums1 are [4,6], and the elements that are not in nums2 are [1,3].
