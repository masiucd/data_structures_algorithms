# Data structures and algorithms

## About

This repository contains implementations of data structures and algorithms using `(GO)[https://golang.org/]`.

Data structures and algorithms are the building blocks of computer programming. They are the tools that help us to solve complex problems in an efficient way. Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for every programmer. It is a common practice to ask data structure and algorithm problems in interviews. So, it is important to have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms.

### Data structures

Data structures are the way to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
Thanks to data structures, we can store data in a way that allows us to access and modify it efficiently.

### Algorithms

Algorithms are the steps to solve a problem. With the right algorithm, we can solve a problem in an efficient way.
