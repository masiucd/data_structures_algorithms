# Count primes

Given an integer `n`, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than `n`.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. For example, 6 is not a prime number because it can be factored as 2 \* 3.

## Example

```go
countPrimes(10) // 4
countPrimes(0) // 0
countPrimes(1) // 0
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= n <= 5 * 10^6`
- The time complexity must be O(n)
- The space complexity must be O(n)
- The input number is a non-negative integer

```
