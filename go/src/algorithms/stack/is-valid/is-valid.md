# Is valid

## Description

- Given a string containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- Space complexity: `O(1)` since we are not using any extra space to solve this problem in place.
