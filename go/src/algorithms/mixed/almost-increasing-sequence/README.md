# Almost Increasing Sequence

## Description

Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

Note: sequence `a0`, `a1`, ..., `an` is considered to be a strictly increasing if `a0 < a1 < ... < an`. Sequence containing only one element is also considered to be strictly increasing.

## Example

- For `sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1]`, the output should be `false`;
- For `sequence = [1, 3, 2]`, the output should be `true`.
