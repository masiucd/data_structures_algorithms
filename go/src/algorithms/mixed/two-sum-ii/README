# Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

## Description

Given an array of integers that is already **_sorted in ascending order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

### Note:

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example 1:

```pseudo
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

### Example 2:

```pseudo
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
```

### Example 3:

```pseudo
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
```
