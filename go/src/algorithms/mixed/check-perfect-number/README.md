# Check for perfect number

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.

A proper divisor is a positive integer that divides a number without leaving a remainder.

For example, 6 is a perfect number because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.

Write a function that checks if a given number is a perfect number.
