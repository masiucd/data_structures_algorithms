# Breath first Search

## Description

Breath first search is a tree traversal algorithm that traverses the tree level by level.
It is commonly used to find the shortest path between two nodes.

## Implementation

The implementation consists of a queue and a visited set.
The queue is used to keep track of the nodes that need to be visited. The visited set is used to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the breath first search algorithm is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the breath first search algorithm is `O(V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices.
