# Remove Element

Remove Element is a problem that asks us to remove all instances of a given value from an array. This is a relatively easy problem to solve, but it can be tricky to solve it with optimal time and space complexity.

## Examples

```
Input: [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2, 2]

Input: [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0, 1, 3, 0, 4]
```
